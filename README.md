Game Mechanics:
The main game mechanic is the firing of the turret. Each turret [character] has 3 hearts and every turn is equivalent to 10 seconds where the player can shoot infinite number of bullets. But it is not easy !! since the player will encounter many challenges on the way. Through trial-and-error, the player can get a feel for the distances and where they would need to aim.
